   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   cp client/.env.example client/.env
   ```
5. **Start the development servers**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

#### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Write tests** for your changes

   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
8. **Create a Pull Request** using our PR template

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Write clear, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use ES6+ features
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`
- Use arrow functions where appropriate
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use TypeScript types where applicable

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper prop types or TypeScript interfaces
- Follow the component file structure:
  ```
  ComponentName/
  â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts
  â”œâ”€â”€ ComponentName.tsx
  â”œâ”€â”€ ComponentName.test.tsx
  â”œâ”€â”€ ComponentName.styles.ts
  â””â”€â”€ types.ts
  ```

### Backend API

- Follow RESTful principles
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Validate all inputs
- Handle errors gracefully
- Write comprehensive tests

### Database

- Use meaningful collection/table names
- Create proper indexes
- Follow data modeling best practices
- Write migration scripts for schema changes

## Testing

### Types of Tests

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual functions and components
2. **Integration Tests** - Test API endpoints and component interactions
3. **E2E Tests** - Test complete user workflows

### Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain high test coverage (>80%)
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and error cases

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```
